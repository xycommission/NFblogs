                        Hi! I'm Nathaniel Morva, a web developer. Throughout my student life (I'm still a student), I've
                        been writing either novels or short stories as a hobby. Whenever I wanted to share something
                        going
                        on in my life, I write a blog, I used to have an account in a blogging website. I deleted that
                        blog
                        a long time ago because I prefer leaving that past behind. In this blogging website, coded by
                        me,
                        and partnered with Faith, I'd like to write reviews about shows, they could be: Anime, K-drama,
                        and
                        Movies. I've seen hundreds of shows and that have made me have a high standard when it comes to
                        watching shows. I'll tackle about the flaws, and if the lesson is relevant and worth watching.

                        Hi! I am Faith de Guzman, a HUMSS student. Ever since I was a child, I have always been a
                        literature
                        enthusiast. Whenever given a chance to enjoy leisure, I always choose to open up a book and let
                        myself
                        dive into a whole new world that is far from the awful reality rather than use my mobile phone.
                        I am
                        also deeply in love with writing. That is the reason why I joined our campus journalism club and
                        eventually became a News Writer and Copyreader who published numerous articles for our school
                        gazette.
                        Furthermore, I tried composing some novels, writing in my journal, and now creating this
                        blogging
                        website with my good partner Nathaniel. In this website, we will share some thoughts,
                        realizations,
                        reviews, and everything in between. We hope that you would support this and join our "train of
                        thoughts"
                        as we progress and develop our authorial prowess more.

            <p class="blog">
                Greetings to you, dear reader. I hope you are having a good day so far. Before anything else, I would
                like to welcome you to this website. My co-chronicler Nathan and I hope you would enjoy your stay here.
                Happy reading! <br><br>

                Anyway, one of the very few people I have been following online is Miss Aileen Xu. She is a lifestyle
                creator and has a YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Lavendaire" target="_blank"><i
                        class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i>Lavendaire</a> and Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lavendaire/" target="_blank"><i
                            class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i>lavendaire</a> where she
                shares tips
                and advice for healing, and the betterment of oneself. She also shares a lot of journal prompts monthly
                online for people to answer and be able to dig deeper and assess themselves regarding their mental
                health, and more aspects of their life. <br><br>

                One of the good prompts I happened to stumble upon on her Instagram account is the question we will be
                answering in this entry. The question that piqued our attention is this: What were you like as a child?
                What do you love to do? <br><br>
                <img src="images/lavendaire.png" alt=""> <br><br>

                "Ever since I was a child, I am a dreamer who dreams big dreams. The child Faith always wants to do
                more.
                The child Faith always wants to prove to people that she can do different awesome things. She was always
                dreaming with her eyes wide open. And, if you ask her what she's dreaming now, she would answer that she
                wants to be a lawyer, an artist, a detective, a journalist, an author, a performer, and everything she
                could be just to make her loved ones so proud of her. <br><br>

                As her older self, I hope and promise to make her happy one day. I promise to make the younger Faith
                happy by making all her dreams—no matter how twisted or impossible it may seem—come true. I will give my
                younger self the happiness she deserves. I will make her proud someday." <br><br>

                I guess you could see that my younger self used to have her head up in the clouds. This must be the
                effect of sticking your nose in books rather than playing with your playmates sometimes. I became so
                imaginative HAHAHAHA. How about you? What were you like as a child? Were you like me? A dreamer?
                <br><br>

                See you in the next entry. Be safe, everyone! <br><br>
