                        Hi! I'm Nathaniel Morva, a web developer. Throughout my student life (I'm still a student), I've
                        been writing either novels or short stories as a hobby. Whenever I wanted to share something
                        going
                        on in my life, I write a blog, I used to have an account in a blogging website. I deleted that
                        blog
                        a long time ago because I prefer leaving that past behind. In this blogging website, coded by
                        me,
                        and partnered with Faith, I'd like to write reviews about shows, they could be: Anime, K-drama,
                        and
                        Movies. I've seen hundreds of shows and that have made me have a high standard when it comes to
                        watching shows. I'll tackle about the flaws, and if the lesson is relevant and worth watching.

                        Hi! I am Faith de Guzman, a HUMSS student. Ever since I was a child, I have always been a
                        literature
                        enthusiast. Whenever given a chance to enjoy leisure, I always choose to open up a book and let
                        myself
                        dive into a whole new world that is far from the awful reality rather than use my mobile phone.
                        I am
                        also deeply in love with writing. That is the reason why I joined our campus journalism club and
                        eventually became a News Writer and Copyreader who published numerous articles for our school
                        gazette.
                        Furthermore, I tried composing some novels, writing in my journal, and now creating this
                        blogging
                        website with my good partner Nathaniel. In this website, we will share some thoughts,
                        realizations,
                        reviews, and everything in between. We hope that you would support this and join our "train of
                        thoughts"
                        as we progress and develop our authorial prowess more.
